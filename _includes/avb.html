<div class='page-heading'>This device uses Android Verified Boot (AVB)</div>
<hr />
<p class="text">This means that installing TWRP or swiping to allow system modifications will prevent you from being able to boot. To bypass AVB's boot prevention, you will have to disable it or install a custom ROM that ships with disabled AVB.</p>
