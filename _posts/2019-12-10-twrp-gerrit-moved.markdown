We are moving the TWRP repository from [OmniRom Gerrit](https://gerrit.omnirom.org) to [TWRP Gerrit] (https://gerrit.twrp.me) retaining the android\_bootable\_recovery project name. If you have any open Change Requests on [OmniRom Gerrit](https://gerrit.omnirom.org) and would like to see them reviewed, please cherry-pick and push them to the repository on [TWRP Gerrit] (https://gerrit.twrp.me).

[Original project URL: ](https://gerrit.omnirom.org/#/q/project:android_bootable_recovery)
[New project URL: ](https://gerrit.twrp.me/q/project:+android_bootable_recovery)

Thanks for all your continued support to the TWRP OSS Project.
