NOTE: Decrypting data is not currently supported on the Nexus 5X. We do not have the money to buy one at the moment. Feel free to donate some money to help buy one if decrypting data is something you would like to see. Otherwise, you can format data and find and install a boot image with forceencrypt disabled and use TWRP as normal.
