The Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 model will NEVER receive official TWRP support. The i9100 does not have a separately bootable recovery partition. Instead, you are stuck with whatever recovery is included in your ROM or kernel or boot image. You may find TWRP included in some ROMs, kernels, or boot images, especially if you can find OmniROM for your device.
